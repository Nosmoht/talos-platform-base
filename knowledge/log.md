# Changelog

## 2026-07-15

- `decisions/0014-capability-profiles-predicate-only.md` added: removes
  `iommu=pt` from the `iommu` provisioning profile. A profile karg is
  base-owned and consumer-unoverridable, so it must carry only what the
  provided atom's `presence_predicate` names; `iommu=pt` is host-DMA tuning
  that reached the catalog by being copied from a README example. Kernel-doc
  wording verified at the primary source.
- `decisions/index.md`: 0014 listed under §Accepted.
- `architecture/capability-composition.md`: shipped-catalog description no
  longer claims the `iommu` profile carries `iommu=pt`; re-verified against
  `profiles.tf`.
- `rules/talos-base-bundle.md` added: the bundle's authoring conventions as an
  OKF Rule document, rendered into the `AGENTS.md` managed block by
  `openknowledge rules apply`. It is the source of truth for them.
- `index.md`: `## Rules` section added; §Bundle conventions reduced to a
  pointer at the rule document plus the non-normative reasoning behind it. The
  bundle-boundary statement now says what it always meant — contracts a
  tarball or schema consumer resolves BY PATH live outside, and the bundle
  ships in no release artifact — with `knowledge/rules/` as the named
  exception for bundle-tooling contracts. `openknowledge.toml` always met the
  same test.
- `openknowledge.toml`: `rule-catalog = "error"`. Verified against v0.5.0 that
  `knowledge/rules/` is the CLI's default rule path, so no `[rules]` section
  is needed.
- `reference/tasks.md`: `knowledge:rules-apply` + `knowledge:rules-check`
  documented, `knowledge:validate` scope corrected; re-verified against
  `Taskfile.yml`.
- `architecture/substrate.md`: repo layout re-verified; `knowledge/rules/`
  added to the bundle's contents.

Pre-flight verification of the rules mechanism against openknowledge v0.5.0
(recorded here because it decided the design): custom rules render from the
default `rules/` path without `[rules].paths`; `rule-catalog = "error"` via
the TOML fails a rule document missing `rule_id`; `rules apply --dry-run`
output is byte-identical between macOS/arm64 and linux/amd64; the block is
first written at end-of-file and a one-time manual move survives later
regeneration, including one that changes the block's length. The renderer
emits only a bullet's first physical line, so rule bullets are written
unwrapped.

## 2026-07-11

- Initial OKF v0.1 bundle. Replaces the retired `docs/` tree: architecture,
  reference, workflow, and glossary concepts regenerated from repository
  source; 13 ADRs migrated to `decisions/` with MADR frontmatter mapped to
  OKF and present-tense claims re-verified against code;
  `component-dependencies.md` dissolved into `architecture/substrate.md`;
  `oci-artifact-verification.md` merged into `workflows/verify-release.md`;
  machine-consumed contracts relocated outside the bundle
  (`platform-hardware-features.yaml`, `schemas/`, `contracts/`).
